##### Encapsulation (Information Hiding)

Combining data and methods on the data and limiting access to some of the data. Present a consistent and usable interface which is independent of how a system is implemented internally. Example, access member variables only via own classes's method.

##### Relationship between classes

1. Dependence (*uses-a*) Service class A uses service class B.
2. Aggregation (*has-a*) Order O has account A.
3. Inheritance (*is-a*) Car C is a vehicle V.

##### SOLID


**Liskov Substitution Principle** An object may be replaced by a sub-object without breaking the program.
